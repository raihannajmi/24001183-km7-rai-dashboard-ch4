# Express API with Sequelize & PostgreSQL

This project is an API built using Express.js, Sequelize ORM, and PostgreSQL. It provides CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations for managing Cars, Drivers, Spareparts, and Users. This document serves as a guide for understanding the structure, setup, and usage of the API.

## Features

- **CRUD Operations for Car**: Manage car entities (create, read, update, delete).
- **CRUD Operations for Driver**: Manage driver entities.
- **CRUD Operations for Sparepart**: Manage sparepart entities.
- **CRUD Operations for User**: Manage user entities.

## Tech Stack

- **Backend Framework**: Express.js
- **ORM**: Sequelize
- **Database**: PostgreSQL
- **Environment Management**: dotenv
